            <p>MIKES <span style="font-size: x-small; font-weight: lighter;">used</span> CAR LOT IS THE BEST PLACE TO BUY CARS ON THE PLANET EARTH! You could buy cars at any other car lot but you WILL GET SCAMMED AND DIE IN REAL LIFE. But not at Mike's! At Mikes YOU ARE FAMILY! NO MATTER WHAT! EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE!</p>
            <p>Don't listen to those lying lawyers at <b>"Greg's New Cars"</b> and their henious claims that we trick people into buying used cars at new car prices! All our cars are new (to you) and you'll feel like a million bucks when you drive away in one of our amazing lil' babies! There's nothing to indicate that in any way that we're lying in a court of law! <b>AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK!</b></p>
