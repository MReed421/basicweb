            <h1>GREG'S NEW CAR LOT IS AWFUL OUR LOT IS WAY BETTER ONLY SHOP HERE!</h1>
            <p>Greg thinks he's so much cooler just because he has things like a "business liscense" and pays "taxes" (What even are those? Really I have no idea), but if he's so cool why didn't I invite him to my birthday party in 5th grade? Everyone knows Greg was never cool and obviously you can't sell good cars if you aren't cool enough to get invited to my birthday party. We had cake and played x-box all night. Haha, Greg! You Stink!</p>
            <p>My buddy Eric once bought a car at <b>"Greg's New Cars"</b> and it turned out to be full of wasps and he died. So why don't'cha think about that one? Huh? I bet you feel real sorry for thinking about buying a car anywhere else now. <b>UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE STUNG BY WASPS OR SOMETHING!?</b></p>
            <img src="images/Sprite-0002.gif" alt="Eric dies because of Greg's waspsy cars...">
            <p>Rest In Peace, Eric. You were the worst mechanic I ever knew...</p>
