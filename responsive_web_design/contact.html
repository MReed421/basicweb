            <h1>WANT TO CONTACT US? GREAT! WELL GO ON THEN!</h1>
            <p><b>PHONE:</b> You can call us anytime during business hours (and sometimes after, if we're feeling particularly desperate). Our number is (555) GRE-ASEY. Please be advised that we may not answer if we're in the middle of haggling with a customer, getting chased by the repo man, or hiding from the health inspector.</p>
            <p><b>EMAIL:</b> You can easily get in contact with us at mikeOO0O0000OO00@hotmail.com easy to remember!</p>
            <p><b>SMOKE SIGNALS:</b> If you're feeling like a true outdoorsman, you can send us a message via smoke signals. Just build a fire, throw some leaves on it, and spell out your message in smoke. We'll keep an eye out for your message and respond accordingly with a series of car honks (which may or may not have any actual meaning).</p>
            <p><b>TELEPATHY:</b> For those who are less interested in physical communication, we're happy to receive messages through extrasensory perception. Simply close your eyes, concentrate really hard, and send your message directly into our brains. We'll respond by sending you a picture of our latest car.</p>
