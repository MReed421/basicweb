    <h2>Welcome to the hive!</h2>

    <p>35% of all crops, and 75% of all flowers are pollinated by bees. Over 100k species of plants rely on bees entirely. Without bees, there would be a massive ecological disaster. If they were to go extinct, it would lead to a significant decline in food production, leading to food shortages and a rise in food prices.</p> 
    
    <p>The decline of honeybee populations is caused by various factors, including habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. Conservation efforts such as the protection of natural habitats, reduction of pesticide use, and promotion of beekeeping are essential in preventing honeybee extinction.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, if you see a honey bee, don't kill it, it's not aggressive like a wasp, and you rely on them more than you think.</p>
